# Project 3: MERN
## Dog Walker

### General Approach

As we were brainstorming ideas, Jay's dog appeared in the zoom call, and we just instantly started thinking about ideas that revolve around dogs. And while considering dogs, we were thinking of what certain needs there would be considering dogs and we arrived upon Dog Walkers. There are many different businesses that allow people to connect and have people dog sit for other dog owners. This app however will be targeting the specific activity of simply walking the dog.

After we decided on the overall project, we started working on the wireframe, getting a general idea of how we want our app to look. Simultaneously as we are working on the wireframe, we are identifying the MVP and postMVP aspects of the app itself and therefore creating our project worksheet as well.

And now we are waiting for project approval..
