# Project 3: MERN
## Dog Walker

### General Approach

As we were brainstorming ideas, Jay's dog appeared in the zoom call, and we just instantly started thinking about ideas that revolve around dogs. And while considering dogs, we were thinking of what certain needs there would be considering dogs and we arrived upon Dog Walkers. There are many different businesses that allow people to connect and have people dog sit for other dog owners. This app however will be targeting the specific activity of simply walking the dog.

After we decided on the overall project, we started working on the wireframe, getting a general idea of how we want our app to look. Simultaneously as we are working on the wireframe, we are identifying the MVP and postMVP aspects of the app itself and therefore creating our project worksheet as well.

And now we are waiting for project approval..

### User Stories

Our users are both dog walkers and those needing their dogs walked. Dog walkers are dog lovers who want to combine the joys of life with their working life--and what better combination is there than to walk dogs?! Dog owners are busy go-getters who understand that it takes a village to care for their much loved pets and they know that they can come to us to help fulfill their dog walking needs.
